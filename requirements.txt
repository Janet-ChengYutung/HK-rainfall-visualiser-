# Minimal runtime dependency required to run `Main.py`:
# - `pygame` is used for the application UI and audio playback.
# - `watchdog` was used for development/watch tasks and is not required to run the app; keep it in a dev requirements file if needed.

# Optional developer/build dependencies (not required to run Main.py):
# watchdog==3.0.0
# pyinstaller==6.16.0
